# Quick Start

!!! success "5 minutes to your first package"
    This guide will have you creating and running your first PSPF package in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** installed ([Download](https://python.org))
- **UV package manager** ([Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **Git** for cloning the repository

!!! info "Need More Details?"
    See the complete [System Requirements](../reference/requirements.md) for detailed version information and platform support.

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the FlavorPack repository
git clone https://github.com/provide-io/flavorpack.git
cd flavorpack

# Install UV if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Set up environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Build Native Components

FlavorPack uses native Go and Rust components for optimal performance:

```bash
# Build all helpers (launchers and builders)
make build-helpers

# Or use the build script directly
./build.sh

# Built binaries will be in dist/bin/ with platform suffixes
```

!!! tip "Pre-built binaries"
    Pre-built binaries for common platforms will be available in future releases.

## Your First Package

### 1. Create a Simple Python App

Create a new file `hello.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""A simple hello world application."""

def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to FlavorPack! 📦")
    print("Your app is running from a self-contained package!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 2. Create a Manifest

Create `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "hello-app"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "My first FlavorPack application"
requires-python = ">=3.11"

[project.scripts]
hello = "hello:main"

[tool.flavor]
entry_point = "hello:main"
```

### 3. Package Your App

```bash
# Create the package
flavor pack --manifest pyproject.toml --output hello.psp

# Output:
# ✨ Creating package: hello.psp
# 📦 Packaging Python application...
# 🔒 Signing package...
# ✅ Package created successfully!
```

### 4. Run Your Package

```bash
# Make it executable (Unix-like systems)
chmod +x hello.psp

# Run it!
./hello.psp

# Output:
# What's your name? Alice
# Hello, Alice! Welcome to FlavorPack! 📦
# Your app is running from a self-contained package!
```

## What Just Happened?

You've created a **self-contained executable** that:

1. **Includes everything** - Python runtime, dependencies, and your code
2. **Runs anywhere** - No Python installation required on the target system
3. **Is cryptographically signed** - Ensures package integrity
4. **Uses smart caching** - Extracts only once for fast subsequent runs

## Understanding the Package Structure

Your `hello.psp` file contains:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Native Launcher       │ ← Platform-specific executable
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Package Index         │ ← Metadata and signature
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Python Runtime        │ ← Embedded Python interpreter
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Your Application      │ ← Your code and dependencies
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Magic Footer 📦🪄     │ ← PSPF format identifier
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## Common Operations

### Verify Package Integrity

```bash
# Check if a package is valid and signed correctly
flavor verify hello.psp

# Output:
# ✅ Package signature valid
# ✅ All checksums verified
# ✅ Package integrity confirmed
```

### Inspect Package Contents

```bash
# View package metadata and contents
flavor inspect hello.psp

# Output:
# Package: hello-app v1.0.0
# Format: PSPF/2025
# Size: 45.2 MB
# Slots:
#   0: Python runtime (38.1 MB)
#   1: Application code (7.1 MB)
```

### Extract Package Contents

```bash
# Extract all slots for inspection (not needed for running)
flavor extract-all hello.psp extracted/

# Lists all extracted files
ls extracted/
```

## Tips for Success

!!! tip "Best Practices"
    - **Keep packages small** - Use `--exclude` to skip unnecessary files
    - **Sign your packages** - Always use signing keys for production
    - **Test on target platforms** - Ensure compatibility before deployment
    - **Use version tags** - Include version in package filename

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    - **Missing dependencies** - Ensure all imports are in requirements
    - **File permissions** - Remember to make packages executable
    - **Path issues** - Use absolute imports in your Python code
